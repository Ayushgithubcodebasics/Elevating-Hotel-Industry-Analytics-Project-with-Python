# Elevating Hotel Industry Analytics Project with Python

In this project, I applied various Python skills and techniques to analyze the hotel domain and provide strategic insights for Atliq Grands, a well-established entity in India's hotel industry.

## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands is currently facing **competition** and a **decline in revenue**. To address these issues, the management team has chosen to leverage data and strategic insights. Lacking internal data expertise, they have enlisted external assistance to analyze the situation, provide actionable insights, and devise effective strategies for customer retention and revenue growth.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to conduct a **comprehensive analysis** of the hotel domain using Python. By employing data-driven insights and strategic recommendations, my aim is to empower Atliq Grands to make **informed decisions** and regain a **competitive edge** in the industry.

## Project Highlights
In this project, I performed the following tasks:

- **Data Cleaning**: I handled missing values and outliers in the data.
- **Data Transformation**: I added occupancy percentage columns for each room type and city.
- **Insights Generation**: I answered key questions such as:
    - What is the average occupancy rate by room type and city?
    - How does the occupancy rate vary on weekdays and weekends?
    - How much revenue is generated per city?
    - What are the monthly revenue trends?
    - Which booking platforms contribute the most to the revenue?
- **Data Visualization**: I leveraged the Matplotlib library to create charts and bars that illustrate the insights.

## Skills Learned
Through this project, I enhanced my proficiency in the following skills:

- **Python Programming**: I used Python for data analysis, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **Pandas Fundamentals**: I created various dataframes, performed group by functions, concatenated and merged data, handled NA values, read csv files, etc.
- **Matplotlib Basics**: I used Matplotlib to create plots, customize axes, add titles and labels, save figures, etc.
